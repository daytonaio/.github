Daytona is a **secure, scalable runtime for AI-generated code execution and agent workflows**. Our open-source platform provides lightning-fast infrastructure (200ms startup) with complete isolation, giving developers and AI systems a safe sandbox for running generated code without risk. The comprehensive **Daytona SDK** offers programmatic control over workspace creation, file operations, and process executionâ€”essential components for building robust AI agents with dynamic lifecycles.

For organizations building AI applications, **Daytona Enterprise** delivers production-ready infrastructure with enterprise-grade security, compliance tools, and flexible deployment options. Our stateful environment snapshots enable persistent agent operations across sessions, making Daytona the ideal foundation for Fortune 500 companies and startups implementing AI agent architectures.
